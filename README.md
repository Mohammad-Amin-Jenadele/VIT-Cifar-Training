# Vision Transformer (ViT) for CIFAR-10 Classification

Vision Transformer (ViT) is a novel architecture proposed for image classification tasks, introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. in the paper "[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)". Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT leverages the Transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence modeling tasks like natural language processing, and applies it directly to image data.

## Motivation

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the cornerstone of computer vision tasks for years, demonstrating exceptional performance in various image recognition tasks. However, CNNs have certain limitations, especially when it comes to scalability and handling long-range dependencies within images. ViT addresses these limitations by reformulating image classification as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where image patches are treated as tokens similar to words in natural language processing tasks.

## Architecture

The core idea of ViT is to break down an input image into fixed-size patches, which are then linearly embedded into high-dimensional vectors. These patch embeddings, along with positional encodings, are fed into a standard Transformer encoder. The resulting sequence of embeddings is then passed through a classification head to produce the final class predictions.

## Key Components

1. **Patch Embeddings**: The input image is divided into non-overlapping patches, and each patch is linearly projected into a lower-dimensional embedding space.

2. **Positional Encodings**: To preserve spatial information, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings, allowing the model to understand the relative positions of different patches.

3. **Transformer Encoder**: The patch embeddings, along with positional encodings, are fed into a Transformer encoder, which consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks.

4. **Classification Head**: The output sequence from the Transformer encoder is processed by a classification head, typically consisting of a single linear layer, to produce class probabilities.

## Advantages

- **Scalability**: ViT can handle images of arbitrary size, making it more scalable compared to traditional CNNs.
- **Interpretable**: The attention mechanism in ViT allows for better interpretability, as the model learns to focus on different parts of the image.
- **Transfer Learning**: ViT can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and fine-tuned on specific tasks with relatively small amounts of labeled data.

## Project Goal

In this project, we aim to implement and train a Vision Transformer model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification.
